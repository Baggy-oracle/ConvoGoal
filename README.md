# ConvoGoal
Convogoal helps you steer conversations to clear goals, actions, and results.
Convogoal is a goal-driven conversation utility that helps you decide what to say next in a conversation based on context, tone, and intent.
Instead of chatting with an AI, you paste a conversation, choose your goal, and get focused next-text suggestions that move the conversation toward your desired outcome in any language

✨ Features 
• Structured conversation input (Me / Them) • Dynamic conversation lines (add or remove context easily) 
• Goal-based suggestions (preset or custom goals) 
• Tone control (casual, polite, funny, confident, etc.) 
• Language-agnostic (works with any language) 
• Utility-style interface (not a chat UI) 
• Wallpaper background with clean overlay design

🧠 How It Works 
1. Paste the conversation line by line 
2. Select a goal (or enter your own) 
3. Choose a tone 
4. Generate next-message suggestions 
5. Pick one, send it, paste the reply 
6. Repeat until your goal is reached
